EtherDream C++ Engine
=====================

Work in progress.

Long-term, I want to create a ZeroMQ-addressable laser projector daemon that 
handles low-level operations such as tracking and blanking the laser. As the
library grows more advanced, I'd like to do 2D and 3D geometry corrections as
well as simply cropping the projection field.

I'm not sure how much low-level control to usurp from client code.
